My final project for this class is a program that inputs monthly bills and finds the 
total amount. I wanted to make a program that could be useful to the black community, 
being that is my community. The black community is the least savvy financially and that 
really impacts our community in a negative way. Many of the people in my community 
don’t know how to budget at all. I created a program to help them easily figure how 
much money they need for bills from month to month. The combination I chose to use 
is Classes/OOP, File I/O, and Stacks. My project could have real world impact in mu 
community. As simple as it is, many people don’t have the time or knowledge to budget 
their monthly bills. This project could make a fast and easy way to quickly figure out 
how much money they need to have per month and how much to have from check to 
check to save to pay these monthly bills.
